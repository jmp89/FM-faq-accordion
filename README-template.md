### What I learned

In this challenge i practiced a lot of CSS, and some "basic" codes like the background i felt like i am too weak.

### Continued development

I'm practicing every day to improve my skills as developer, and the next step in the academy's bootcamp is about backend, so i hope that makes me grow nicely.

I worked in a little project for our academy, practicing everything we already learned.
